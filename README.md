# latam-urban-mobility-analysis
Python analysis exploring the correlation between urban traffic congestion (TomTom Index) and economic productivity (OECD Data) in Latin American cities (2024)

Urban Mobility & Economic Productivity in LATAM Cities
Project Role: Data Analyst at Latin American Development Bank

📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between urban mobility (congestion levels, travel times) and economic productivity (GDP per capita, unemployment) across major Latin American cities. The goal is to identify high-impact infrastructure investment opportunities.

📊 Datasets Used
TomTom Traffic Index: Real-time traffic congestion data (Jams delay, Traffic Index, Travel Times).

OECD Cities: Annual economic indicators (GDP per capita, Unemployment %, Population).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Pandas & NumPy (Data Cleaning and Merging).

Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Environment: Jupyter Notebook.

🚀 Key Objectives & Methodology
Data Harmonization: Standardized city and country names across two heterogeneous sources.

Feature Engineering: Extracted 2024 data and calculated aggregated traffic averages per city.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified cities with high congestion but low productivity (investment targets).

Correlation Analysis: Measured the strength of the relationship between travel delays and GDP.

💡 Business Questions Addressed
Which LATAM cities show high congestion and low economic productivity?

Which cities present the most efficient combined indicators?

What variables have the strongest impact on urban development?
